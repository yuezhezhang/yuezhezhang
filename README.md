- ðŸ”­ Welcome to my Github page! 
- ðŸŒ± I am currently a MSc student in Robotics at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering (Xuteli School, with honours) at [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/).
- ðŸ˜„ I am interested in motion planning for mobile robots and robot arms and human robot interaction. Hope one day we can bring more robots to people's daily lives.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to contact me if you want to discuss interesting topics about robotics.
